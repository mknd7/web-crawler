# Web Crawler
This is a Python-based web crawler built upon Udacity's CS101's original.

Frontend is currently a console-based query system.
Uses BeautifulSoup to parse HTML, and is capable of reading gzip cache files.
Run the driver.py program to execute a bunch of options:
* View entire index
* View all words encountered
* View ranks of pages visited
* Query the index

Note: The crawler does not respect robots.txt as of now.
Any inappropriate change of seed page is not suggested.
